While pain (A) can be a factor, it is a subjective symptom. Serous drainage (C) is a normal finding. A statement about being tired (D) is not directly related to skin integrity."

A closed wound is one where the skin surface is intact, and common examples are bruises or fractures. The other options are incorrect. An open wound has a break in the skin (A). The severity of the damage is not always reflected by skin integrity alone (D), and a full-thickness wound is more severe than a superficial wound."
