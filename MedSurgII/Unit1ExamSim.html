    "questionText": "A 78-year-old patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is admitted with hypoxemia. The nurse notes an ECG strip with an irregular rhythm, a rate of 110 bpm, and a P wave that precedes each QRS complex, but the P wave's shape and size vary from beat to beat. What is the most likely dysrhythmia?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Atrial fibrillation",
      "B": "Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)",
      "C": "Wandering atrial pacemaker (WAP)",
      "D": "Sinus arrhythmia"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is an irregular rhythm with a rate over 100 bpm and at least three different P wave morphologies, a common finding in patients with COPD. Wandering atrial pacemaker (WAP) is similar but has a rate below 100 bpm. Atrial fibrillation lacks organized P waves, and sinus arrhythmia has uniform P waves.",
    "section": "Dysrhythmia Identification",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "The nurse is preparing to administer adenosine to a patient with a stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) at 180 bpm. What is the most critical consideration before administering this medication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ensuring the patient has a patent airway.",
      "B": "Having a pacemaker on standby.",
      "C": "Having the patient in a supine position and administering the drug via a central line.",
      "D": "Synchronizing a cardioverter to the patient's QRS complex."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Adenosine has an extremely short half-life and must reach the heart quickly to be effective. The patient should be supine for safety and the drug administered through a large bore IV in the antecubital fossa or closer to the heart, followed by a rapid saline flush.",
    "section": "Pharmacology and Management",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient’s ECG shows a QRS duration of 0.16 seconds. The nurse understands that this finding could be a sign of which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A delayed impulse through the AV node.",
      "B": "A premature beat from the SA node.",
      "C": "A bundle branch block.",
      "D": "A shortened ventricular repolarization time."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "A widened QRS complex (normal is 0.06-0.10 seconds) indicates a delay or block in the electrical conduction system below the AV node, such as a bundle branch block. A prolonged PR interval indicates an AV node delay.",
    "section": "EKG Interpretation",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient with a history of acute inferior wall myocardial infarction is admitted with a new onset of dizziness and a heart rate of 45 bpm. The nurse knows that this bradycardia is most likely caused by which physiological mechanism?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Direct injury to the SA node.",
      "B": "Increased sympathetic nervous system tone.",
      "C": "Compression of the Purkinje fibers.",
      "D": "Increased vagal nerve stimulation."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "rationale": "The right coronary artery, which supplies the inferior wall of the heart, also supplies the AV node. An inferior wall MI can stimulate the vagus nerve, leading to a parasympathetic response and sinus bradycardia.",
    "section": "Pathophysiology and Causation",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient with a history of digitalis toxicity is admitted to the ICU. The nurse observes a rhythm with a chaotic, irregular ventricular rate, a very rapid atrial rate that cannot be determined, and no discernible P waves. The QRS complexes are wide and bizarre. What is the most likely dysrhythmia?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Atrial fibrillation.",
      "B": "Ventricular fibrillation.",
      "C": "Atrial flutter with variable block.",
      "D": "Atrial fibrillation with aberrant ventricular conduction."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "rationale": "The rhythm is atrial fibrillation (chaotic atrial activity, irregular ventricular rate) but with a wide QRS complex. This 'aberrant conduction' is a key finding and can be caused by drug toxicity, such as with digitalis.",
    "section": "Complex Dysrhythmia Identification",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "The nurse is analyzing an ECG strip and notes a QT interval of 0.52 seconds. The nurse knows that a prolonged QT interval puts the patient at risk for which life-threatening dysrhythmia?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Atrial flutter.",
      "B": "Torsades de pointes.",
      "C": "Sinus arrhythmia.",
      "D": "Ventricular asystole."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "A prolonged QT interval indicates a delay in ventricular repolarization, which can make the heart vulnerable to a specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia called Torsades de pointes.",
    "section": "EKG Interpretation and Risk",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient with a history of heart failure is admitted for dyspnea and fatigue. The nurse notes an ECG with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Which electrolyte imbalance should the nurse be most concerned about as a contributing factor?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypernatremia.",
      "B": "Hypercalcemia.",
      "C": "Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.",
      "D": "Hyperkalemia."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are well-known to increase myocardial irritability, leading to ventricular ectopy like PVCs. These are common in heart failure patients, especially those on diuretic therapy.",
    "section": "Pathophysiology and Causation",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient is experiencing a sudden, unprovoked episode of sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 42 bpm and reports feeling dizzy. The nurse administers atropine IV as ordered. Which physiological response indicates a successful action of the drug?",
    "options": {
