   "questionText":"A 72-year-old patient with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with a 3-hour history of severe, unrelenting substernal chest pain. He also reports new-onset dyspnea and extreme fatigue. An ECG shows ST-segment elevation. The nurse understands the patient is experiencing a STEMI. Which of the following nursing interventions is the highest priority upon his arrival?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"Administering a thrombolytic agent to dissolve the clot within 30 minutes of arrival.",
      "b":"Placing the patient in a physical rest position with the head of a bed elevated.",
      "c":"Obtaining a large bore IV access and drawing labs, including cardiac biomarkers.",
      "d":"Initiating continuous cardiac monitoring and obtaining a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"D",
   "rationale":"For a patient with a suspected STEMI, the most critical and time-sensitive initial nursing intervention is to obtain an ECG as soon as possible, within 10 minutes of arrival, to confirm the diagnosis and guide immediate treatment. Continuous cardiac monitoring is also essential to detect dysrhythmias, which are common complications. While the other actions are necessary, the ECG and monitoring are the first steps in the \"Time is Muscle\" protocol."
},
{
   "questionText":"A patient with unstable angina is receiving nitroglycerin. The nurse understands that this medication's primary therapeutic effect is to:",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"Increase cardiac contractility and improve stroke volume.",
      "b":"Dissolve existing coronary artery thrombi.",
      "c":"Relax coronary arteries and reduce the heart's workload.",
      "d":"Decrease the resistance to the ejection of blood from the ventricle (afterload)."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"C",
   "rationale":"The study material states that nitroglycerin relaxes the coronary arteries, increasing the heart's blood supply. It also relaxes other blood vessels, which reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart, thereby easing the heart's workload. It does not dissolve clots (thrombolytics do), nor does its primary effect increase contractility or directly decrease afterload."
},
{
   "questionText":"A nurse is reviewing the laboratory results for a patient suspected of having a myocardial infarction. The patient's CPK-MB levels are elevated, but troponins are still within the normal range. Based on the provided study material, which of the following is the most likely reason for this discrepancy?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"The patient has a concurrent skeletal muscle injury that is elevating the CPK-MB.",
      "b":"The patient is more than 48 hours post-myocardial infarction.",
      "c":"The elevated CPK-MB indicates a NSTEMI, which does not elevate troponins.",
      "d":"The patient's symptoms are likely due to Prinzmetal's angina, not an infarction."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"A",
   "rationale":"The study material notes that CPK-MB \"May be related to skeletal injuries and is not cardiac specific.\" This is a key limitation of the test. Since troponins are cardiac specific and take 4-6 hours to elevate, a patient with an elevated CPK-MB and normal troponins likely has a skeletal injury. The patient is likely not more than 48 hours post-MI since CPK-MB levels return to normal within 48-72 hours. Both STEMI and NSTEMI elevate troponins. Prinzmetal's angina is a vasospasm, not a myocardial infarction."
},
{
   "questionText":"A patient is being prepared for a Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) via the femoral artery. The nurse places an \"X\" on the patient's pedal pulses bilaterally. What is the most critical reason for this pre-procedural nursing action?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"To provide a baseline for assessing the patient's peripheral perfusion post-procedure.",
      "b":"To identify the location for the post-procedure groin assessment.",
      "c":"To prevent the development of a venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the lower extremities.",
      "d":"To mark the site where a sheath will be inserted for the procedure."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"A",
   "rationale":"The study material lists \"Mark pulses with marker & 'X'\" as a pre-procedure nursing action for PCI. This is done to establish a baseline for comparison. The most critical assessment post-procedure is to check the groin site and peripheral pulses first, looking for changes in perfusion."
},
{
   "questionText":"A nurse is caring for a patient experiencing cardiogenic shock due to an acute myocardial infarction. The nurse understands this is a severe complication of impaired central perfusion. The primary goal of nursing interventions for this patient would be to:",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"Increase afterload to improve blood pressure.",
      "b":"Decrease contractility to reduce myocardial oxygen demand.",
      "c":"Improve cardiac output to restore oxygenated blood flow to the body tissues.",
      "d":"Administer a thrombolytic agent to dissolve any remaining clot."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"C",
   "rationale":"The study material notes that severe impairment of central perfusion is \"associated with shock\" and results from inadequate cardiac output. The primary goal is to address the underlying cause, which is the failure of the heart to pump effectively. Improving cardiac output is the key to restoring systemic perfusion and reversing shock. Increasing afterload would worsen the heart's workload. Decreasing contractility would be contraindicated as the heart is already failing. While thrombolytics are used for MI, they are not the primary treatment for the shock state itself."
},
{
   "questionText":"A patient presents with a history of exertional chest pain that is consistently relieved by rest. The nurse is preparing to provide patient education. The nurse's teaching should focus on which of the following?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"The importance of immediate emergency department visits for all chest pain episodes.",
      "b":"The use of calcium antagonists and nitrates to control coronary spasms.",
      "c":"The role of nitroglycerin in relaxing coronary arteries and easing the heart's workload.",
      "d":"The signs and symptoms of unstable angina, as this condition is often the first step to an MI."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"C",
   "rationale":"The patient's symptoms (exertional pain relieved by rest) are characteristic of Angina Pectoris. The study material states that for this type of angina, \"chest discomfort is normally relieved with rest, nitroglycerin or both.\" The nurse's teaching should focus on the mechanism of nitroglycerin's action for this specific type of angina. Unstable angina is characterized by pain at rest that is not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Prinzmetal's is a spasm, and emergency visits are for unstable angina/MI."
},
{
   "questionText":"A patient is being discharged from the hospital after a STEMI. The nurse provides education on potential long-term complications. Which of the following complications should the nurse include in the teaching?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"Pericarditis",
      "b":"Atrioventricular block",
      "c":"Left ventricular thrombus",
      "d":"Ventricular arrhythmias"
   },
   "correctAnswer":"A",
   "rationale":"The study material lists \"pericardial complications such as pericarditis\" as a long-term complication of an acute MI. Atrioventricular block and ventricular arrhythmias are electrical complications that most commonly occur within 24 hours. A left ventricular thrombus is a bleeding/thrombotic complication that may occur at any time within the first week."
},
{
   "questionText":"A nurse is assessing a patient with a confirmed left ventricular thrombus. The nurse understands this complication of an MI is categorized as which of the following?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"An ischemic complication.",
      "b":"An embolic, thrombotic, and bleeding complication.",
      "c":"A mechanical complication.",
      "d":"An electrical complication."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"B",
   "rationale":"The study material lists \"embolic, thrombotic, and bleeding complications, such as left ventricular thrombus.\" This is the most specific and accurate classification provided in the text."
},
{
   "questionText":"A patient is admitted to the cardiac unit with a suspected myocardial infarction. The nurse prepares to draw a series of cardiac enzyme labs. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the expected timeline of these lab results?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"CPK-MB and Troponin will both elevate at the same time, within 4-6 hours.",
      "b":"Troponin levels will elevate first and remain elevated for a longer period than CPK-MB.",
      "c":"CPK-MB will elevate first, peak in 12-20 hours, and return to normal in 48-72 hours.",
      "d":"Both CPK-MB and Troponin will be elevated immediately upon the onset of symptoms."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"C",
   "rationale":"The study material states that CPK-MB \"Elevates within 4–8 hr, peaks in 12–20 hr, returns to normal in 48–72 hr.\" It also states that Troponins elevate at 4-6 hours, peak at 14-18 hours, and return to baseline over 6-7 days. While troponins may elevate slightly earlier, CPK-MB has a more rapid peak and decline. Neither marker is elevated immediately upon the onset of symptoms."
},
{
   "questionText":"A patient with a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is experiencing claudication. The nurse understands this is a manifestation of impaired tissue perfusion related to which of the following pathophysiological concepts?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"Inadequate cardiac output.",
      "b":"A lack of patent vessels.",
      "c":"Excessive capillary permeability.",
      "d":"High hydrostatic pressure."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"B",
   "rationale":"PAD is an exemplar of local/tissue perfusion. The study material states that tissue perfusion \"Requires patent vessels.\" Claudication is a symptom of arterial occlusion or narrowing, which represents a lack of patent vessels, thereby impairing blood flow to the target tissue (the muscles of the leg). The other options relate more to central perfusion or fluid shifts, not a lack of blood flow in the arteries."
},
{
   "questionText":"A nurse is caring for a patient with a STEMI. The patient asks why a beta-blocker is being administered. The nurse's response should be based on which of the following actions of the medication?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"It increases preload, leading to improved cardiac output.",
      "b":"It decreases heart rate and blood pressure, which reduces myocardial workload.",
      "c":"It dissolves the thrombus in the coronary artery, allowing blood to flow.",
      "d":"It improves the contractility of the cardiac muscle."
   },
   "correctAnswer":"B",
   "rationale":"The study material lists beta-blockers as a treatment to \"manage HR, BP and can affect preload/afterload.\" By managing heart rate and blood pressure, the medication reduces the workload on the heart, thereby minimizing myocardial damage and preserving function. The other options describe the actions of vasodilators (A), thrombolytics (C), and inotropes (D)."
},
{
   "questionText":"A 58-year-old male presents with sudden, sharp chest pain that is exacerbated by inspiration and lying down. He has a history of a recent MI. The nurse suspects which of the following post-infarction complications?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"Reinfarction",
      "b":"Pericarditis",
      "c":"Left ventricular thrombus",
      "d":"Atrioventricular block"
   },
   "correctAnswer":"B",
   "rationale":"The patient's symptoms (chest pain exacerbated by inspiration and position changes) are classic signs of pericarditis. The study material lists \"pericardial complications Post-infarction such as pericarditis\" as a potential complication. Reinfarction is a type of angina/ischemic complication. A left ventricular thrombus is a thrombotic complication. An AV block is an electrical complication."
},
{
   "questionText":"A patient is being evaluated for potential heart failure. The nurse understands that this condition is an exemplar of impaired central perfusion and is characterized by which of the following?",
   "type":"mc",
   "section":"Perfusion",
   "options":{
      "a":"Increased cardiac output.",
      "b":"Inadequate cardiac output.",
