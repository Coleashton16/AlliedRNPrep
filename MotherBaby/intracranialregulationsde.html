 {
    "questionText": "A 5-year-old child is admitted to the pediatric ICU following a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt revision. Vital signs are T 37.5°C, HR 68 beats/minute, BP 120/70 mmHg, and RR 20 breaths/minute. The nurse notes the child's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score has dropped from 15 to 13, and the left pupil is now sluggish compared to the right. The child has been vomiting frequently.\n\nWhich action is the nurse’s **highest priority** at this time?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer the ordered PRN antiemetic (ondansetron) and elevate the head of the bed (HOB) to 45 degrees.",
      "B": "Initiate a peripheral IV infusion of 3% Normal Saline (hypertonic saline) as ordered and notify the neurosurgeon immediately.",
      "C": "Prepare for intubation and request a STAT head CT scan to assess for hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.",
      "D": "Suction the nasopharynx to protect the airway from aspiration and check the shunt insertion site for swelling."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "The signs—**bradycardia** (part of Cushing's response), **GCS drop**, **sluggish unilateral pupil**, and vomiting—indicate acutely increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and high risk for herniation. The immediate priority is to *chemically* reduce the cerebral edema and pressure while simultaneously notifying the surgical team. Administering hypertonic saline is the most rapid medical intervention to draw fluid out of the brain tissue.",
    "type": "mc",
    "section": "Pediatric Intracranial Regulation"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "The parents of a 10-year-old receiving levetiracetam (Keppra) for a new seizure disorder are being educated on side effects and safety.\n\nWhich instructions should the nurse include in the teaching? (Select All That Apply)",
    "options": {
      "A": "Monitor your child closely for changes in mood, increased aggression, or thoughts of self-harm.",
      "B": "Ensure the medication is administered at the same time every day, and never stop it abruptly.",
      "C": "Your child must avoid sports like swimming and bicycling until the physician approves.",
      "D": "If a dose is missed, administer the dose immediately, but never double the dose at the next scheduled time.",
      "E": "If a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, administer the prescribed rectal diazepam or nasal midazolam and call 911."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A, B, D, E",
    "rationale": "These are all standard warnings for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) covering adherence, prevention of toxicity, management of status epilepticus, and monitoring for the well-known psychiatric side effects associated with levetiracetam (Keppra). Most children with controlled seizures can participate in supervised activities, including swimming, with appropriate safety precautions.",

    "questionText": "A 16-year-old presented to the emergency department after a concussion and was placed on neurological checks every hour. The nurse notes the following change 3 hours after admission:\n\n**Time 1: GCS 15. Pupils 3mm bilaterally, brisk reaction. V/S stable. Reports headache 4/10.**\n**Time 2: GCS 14 (Confused, disoriented to time). Pupils 4mm right, 3mm left, brisk. V/S stable. Reports nausea.**\n\nBased on the change in neurological status, which is the nurse's **priority action**?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Continue neuro checks every hour and notify the physician of the change in GCS.",
      "B": "Restrict fluids and administer PRN antiemetics to prevent vomiting, which increases ICP.",
      "C": "Increase the Head of the Bed (HOB) to 30 degrees and dim the room lights.",
      "D": "Assess the patient for signs of posturing and prepare for possible intubation."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "rationale": "A drop in GCS, particularly involving confusion or loss of orientation, is the single most critical and sensitive indicator of neurological deterioration after head trauma. Immediate notification of the provider is mandatory so further diagnostics (e.g., CT scan) can be ordered.",

    "questionText": "A 9-month-old infant is admitted with a high fever, extreme irritability, and a positive Kernig sign. Bacterial meningitis is suspected. The nurse performs a lumbar puncture (LP) and is awaiting results.\n\nWhich action demonstrates the nurse’s understanding of infection control specific to this diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ensuring the infant is isolated in a negative-pressure room.",
      "B": "Initiating contact precautions, including gloves and gown, during all care.",
      "C": "Placing a surgical mask on the infant when transporting for diagnostic imaging.",
      "D": "Initiating droplet precautions and limiting visitors to essential personnel only."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "rationale": "Bacterial meningitis, often caused by *Neisseria meningitidis*, is transmitted via large respiratory droplets. Droplet precautions (mask, private room) must be initiated immediately until the infectious agent is ruled out or appropriate antibiotics have been given for 24 hours.",

    "questionText": "A 14-year-old in DKA is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation (0.9% NS at 1.5 times maintenance) and insulin. Three hours into treatment, the child suddenly becomes lethargic, reports a severe headache, and the GCS drops from 15 to 12.\n\nThe nurse recognizes these findings as suggestive of cerebral edema. Which change in the client's current orders is the **most appropriate and urgent** intervention?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decrease the insulin infusion rate by 50% and re-check blood glucose.",
      "B": "Discontinue the current IV fluid and initiate 3% Normal Saline (hypertonic saline).",
      "C": "Increase the rate of the current 0.9% NS infusion to rapidly correct dehydration.",
      "D": "Elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees and administer a PRN benzodiazepine."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Cerebral edema during DKA treatment is a life-threatening emergency. The primary treatment is the immediate administration of a hyperosmolar solution (3% NS or Mannitol) to rapidly draw water out of the brain tissue and reduce ICP.",
