It involves diagnosing and treating human responses to health problems, and advocating for individuals, families, groups, and communities.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">International Council of Nurses (ICN) (2021):</span> Nursing includes independent and team-based care for people of all ages, whether sick or well, in all settings.

Nurses also advocate, promote a safe environment, do research, help shape health policy, and manage patient care.</li>

                            <li><span class="font-bold">Care Provider:</span> Your primary job! You'll use critical thinking to decide what to do, hands-on skills to perform tasks, communication skills to talk with patients and families, and ethical/legal understanding to stay within your professional boundaries. You'll use the <span class="font-bold">nursing process</span> (assess, diagnose, plan, implement, evaluate) to guide your care.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Educator:</span> You'll teach patients about their medications, procedures, and how to stay healthy. This is super important for <span class="font-bold">discharge planning</span> so patients can care for themselves at home. You need to make sure information is easy to understand (this is called <span class="font-bold">health literacy</span>).</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Advocate:</span> You speak up for your patients! You'll help them understand information, respect their decisions (even if different from your own), and communicate their wishes to other healthcare providers. This is especially important when patients can't speak for themselves.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Leader:</span> You'll guide and inspire others, working towards common goals in patient care. This involves good communication, problem-solving, and motivating your team.</li>

                            <li><span class="font-bold">Manager:</span> You'll organize and coordinate all the care and treatments for your patients, making sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. You might even manage a whole unit!</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Researcher:</span> Even if you don't do formal research, nurses use <span class="font-bold">evidence-based practice (EBP)</span>. This means using the best available research evidence, along with your clinical judgment and patient preferences, to make decisions about care. You'll constantly be looking for the best ways to do things!</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Collaborator:</span> You'll work closely with doctors, LPNs, nursing assistants (UAP), social workers, therapists, and other healthcare team members to provide high-quality care. Teamwork is essential!</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Delegator:</span> You'll learn to assign certain tasks to other qualified healthcare personnel, like UAP or LPNs. But remember, you (the RN) are always ultimately responsible for supervising the care and ensuring it's done safely and correctly.</li>

The assignment includes care of five medical patients. After receiving the night shift report, John makes rounds on the five patients, assesses each patient, lists patient problems, sets patient goals, and plans care for all five patients for the day. During the shift, John administers intravenous (IV) medications, ensures that oral medications are administered by the licensed practical nurse (LPN), instructs the unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) to bathe two of the patients who need assistance, assists a patient with ambulation, provides discharge education on a new medication, evaluates and updates the plan of care for each patient, and notifies the primary care providers (PCPs) of critically abnormal blood work results for two patients.

                        <br><br>At a recent continuing education conference, John learned about new research concerning administering intramuscular (IM) medication in the deltoid muscle.
