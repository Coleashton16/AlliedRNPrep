            <p class="mb-4">
                These Terms of Service and Your use of the Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State of Creator's Residence], applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of [State of Creator's Residence], without regard to its conflict of law principles.

            <p class="mb-4">
                **Any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by binding arbitration.** Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where appropriate, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes ("AAA Rules"). The arbitration shall be held in [City, State of Creator's Residence], or via telephone conference, as mutually agreed upon. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-3">5.3 Restriction on Litigation and Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, **no arbitration or claim shall be joined with any other proceeding and no dispute shall be subject to class-action arbitration.** This provision is material to the continued offering of the Service, and the User hereby waives any right to resolve disputes in any court of law, thereby agreeing to mandatory arbitration as the exclusive means of dispute resolution.

                These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by Us on the Service constitute the entire agreement and understanding between You and Us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Service operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of Our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond Our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Service and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
